# static-phantom-renderer-brunch

Render static pages of your application with phantomjs. It will work with `--optimize` only. It will start a webserver or using the configured host, rendering each path with phantomjs and saving the resulting html into public/:path/index.html.


## Installation
You can install phantomjs with [homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/)

```shell
brew install phantomjs
```

## Config
```coffeescript
	staticPhantomRenderer:
		paths: ['', 'projects', 'projects/[0..3]', 'team'] # required: list of paths to render
		host: http://localhost:8080 # optional, host used to render
```
Paths should be a list of strings, each representing a page to be rendered. You can indicate id ranges with [a..b].
If host is omitted, it will start a node http-server serving the public folder. But you can use this option to start a server by yourself before building the project. 

If you want to preserve the beginning or the end of the document from beihng changed by your javascript, you can use the following comments in your index.html:

```html
<!-- static-renderer BEGIN -->
```
Everything before that comment will be copied from app/assets/index.html instead of being evaluated via phantomjs.

```html
<!-- static-renderer END -->
```
Everything after that comment will be copied from app/assets/index.html instead of being evaluated via phantomjs.
